          <p>I'm a real estate broker and brokerage owner in Austion with over 11 years experience helping clients throughout the Austin area find their new home. Referring your clients to me you can be assured they will recieve great service with a thorough market understanding and a deft ability to navigate a seller's market. Why's that important to you? Because when your clients work with me they will be under contract more quickly in a house they love and you will benefit by recieving a referral fee. What could be better?</p>
